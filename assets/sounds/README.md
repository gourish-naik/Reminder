# Alarm Sounds

This directory should contain alarm sound files:

- `alarm1.wav` - Default alarm sound
- `alarm2.wav` - Gentle bell sound  
- `alarm3.wav` - Classic alarm sound

For web deployment, these files should be placed in the public directory or served as static assets.

Note: In a production app, you would include actual audio files here. For demo purposes, the app references these paths but gracefully handles missing files.
